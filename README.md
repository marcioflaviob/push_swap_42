# push_swap


This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.


## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcioflaviob/push_swap_42.git && cd push_swap_42
```

## Usage

To create the sorting executable:

```bash
make
```


To create the checker: 


```bash
make bonus
```


To run the algorithm:

The numbers can be either in between double quotes separated by a space or just their own argument.
Accepted numbers are between int MIN and int MAX and no duplicates.

Below is an example:

```bash
./push_swap "1 2 3 4" 5 6 7 8 9 "52 65 89" 105
```

To run the checker: 

```bash
./push_swap "1 2 3 4" 5 6 7 8 9 "52 65 89" 105 | ./checker
```
